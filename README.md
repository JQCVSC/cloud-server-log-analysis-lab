## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Creating Sample Logs

1. **Create a Sample Log File:**

   Start by creating a sample log file (`web_server.log`) with some suspicious entries to analyze. Hereâ€™s an example of what the log entries might look like:

   ```plaintext
   192.168.1.1 - - [01/Jul/2023:10:00:01 +0000] "GET /login.php HTTP/1.1" 200 1234
   192.168.1.2 - - [01/Jul/2023:10:00:02 +0000] "GET /products.php?id=1 UNION SELECT * FROM users HTTP/1.1" 400 567
   192.168.1.1 - - [01/Jul/2023:10:00:03 +0000] "POST /login.php HTTP/1.1" 401 789
   192.168.1.3 - - [01/Jul/2023:10:00:04 +0000] "GET /admin.php HTTP/1.1" 403 321
   192.168.1.2 - - [01/Jul/2023:10:00:05 +0000] "GET /products.php?id=2 OR 1=1 HTTP/1.1" 200 987
   192.168.1.1 - - [01/Jul/2023:10:00:06 +0000] "POST /login.php HTTP/1.1" 401 789
   192.168.1.4 - - [01/Jul/2023:10:00:07 +0000] "GET /wp-admin.php?user=admin&password=admin HTTP/1.1" 404 452
   192.168.1.5 - - [01/Jul/2023:10:00:08 +0000] "POST /upload.php HTTP/1.1" 500 1337
   192.168.1.6 - - [01/Jul/2023:10:00:09 +0000] "GET /login.php?username=admin&password=' OR '1'='1'-- HTTP/1.1" 200 1432
   192.168.1.7 - - [01/Jul/2023:10:00:10 +0000] "GET /setup.php?cmd=cat /etc/passwd HTTP/1.1" 400 678
   ```

2. **Save the Log File:**

   Save this file as `web_server.log` on your local machine.

### Step 2: Setting Up Google Cloud Environment

1. **Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account:**

   If you haven't already, create a free account on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) to access free credits for new users.

2. **Create Google Cloud Storage Buckets:**

   - **Log Storage Bucket:** Create a bucket named `your-log-bucket` for storing log files.
   - **Report Storage Bucket:** Create another bucket named `your-report-bucket` for storing generated reports.

3. **Upload the Sample Log File:**

   Upload your `web_server.log` file to the `your-log-bucket` bucket in Google Cloud Storage.

### Step 3: Writing the Python Log Analyzer Script

1. **Create Your Python Script:**

   Use the following Python script to parse the log files, detect potential security threats, and generate a report:

   ```python
   import re
   from google.cloud import storage
   from collections import Counter
   import json

   def download_blob(bucket_name, source_blob_name, destination_file_name):
       storage_client = storage.Client()
       bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
       blob = bucket.blob(source_blob_name)
       blob.download_to_filename(destination_file_name)

   def analyze_logs(data, context):
       # Download the log file from Cloud Storage
       bucket_name = "your-log-bucket"
       source_blob_name = "web_server.log"
       destination_file_name = "/tmp/web_server.log"
       download_blob(bucket_name, source_blob_name, destination_file_name)



       # Patterns to look for
       sql_injection_pattern = r"(?i)(UNION|SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|DROP|FROM|WHERE)"
       brute_force_pattern = r"(?i)(login|authenticate|auth).*failed"
       
       sql_injection_attempts = []
       brute_force_attempts = []
       ip_counts = Counter()

       with open(destination_file_name, 'r') as file:
           for line in file:
               # Extract IP address (assuming it's the first element in each log line)
               ip = line.split()[0]
               ip_counts[ip] += 1

               # Check for SQL injection attempts
               if re.search(sql_injection_pattern, line):
                   sql_injection_attempts.append(line.strip())

               # Check for brute force attempts
               if re.search(brute_force_pattern, line):
                   brute_force_attempts.append(line.strip())

       # Generate report
       report = {
           "sql_injection_attempts": sql_injection_attempts,
           "brute_force_attempts": brute_force_attempts,
           "top_10_ips": ip_counts.most_common(10)
       }

       # Save report to Cloud Storage
       storage_client = storage.Client()
       report_bucket = storage_client.bucket("your-report-bucket")
       report_blob = report_bucket.blob("security_report.json")
       report_blob.upload_from_string(json.dumps(report, indent=2))

       print(f"Analysis complete. Report saved to your-report-bucket/security_report.json")

   # For local testing
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       analyze_logs(None, None)
   ```

2. **Save the Python Script:**

   Save the script as `log_analyzer.py`.

### Step 4: Deploying the Script as a Cloud Function

1. **Create a New Google Cloud Function:**

   - Go to **Cloud Functions** in the Google Cloud Console.
   - Click **Create Function**.
   - Set the runtime to Python 3.9 or higher.
   - Name the function `analyze_logs`.
   - Set the trigger type to **Cloud Storage** and select the `your-log-bucket`.

2. **Upload the Python Script:**

   - Copy and paste the contents of `log_analyzer.py` into the inline editor.

3. **Deploy the Function:**

   - Click **Deploy** to deploy your cloud function.

### Step 5: Testing Your Cloud Function

1. **Upload a Log File:**

   Upload a log file to your `your-log-bucket` in Google Cloud Storage to trigger the function.

2. **Check the Generated Report:**

   Once the function has executed, check `your-report-bucket` for a new `security_report.json` file that contains the analysis results.
